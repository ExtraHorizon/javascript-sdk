# Extra Horizon JavaScript SDK

This package serves as a JavaScript wrapper around all [Extra Horizon](https://www.extrahorizon.com/cloud-services) cloud services.

## Features

- [Auth][auth]: Provides authentication functionality. The Authentication service supports both OAuth 1.0a and OAuth 2.0 standards.
- [Users][users]: The user service stands in for managing users themselves, as well as roles related to users and groups of users.
- [Data][data]: A flexible data storage for structured data. Additionally, the service enables you to configure a state machine for instances of the structured data. You can couple actions that need to be triggered by the state machine, when/as the entities (instance of structured data) change their state. Thanks to these actions you can define automation rules (see later for more in depth description). These actions also make it possible to interact with other services.
- [Files][files]: A service that handles file storage, metadata & file retrieval based on tokens.
- [Tasks][tasks]: Start functions on demand, directly or at a future moment.
- [Templates][templates]: The template service manages templates used to build emails. It can be used to retrieve, create, update or delete templates as well as resolving them.
- [Mails][mails]: Provides mail functionality for other services.
- [Configurations][configurations]: Provides storage for custom configuration objects. On different levels (general, groups, users, links between groups and users).
- [Dispatchers][dispatchers]: Configure actions that need to be invoked when a specific event is/was triggered.
- [Payments][payments]: A service that provides payment functionality.
- [Profiles][profiles]: Storage service of profiles. A profile is a separate object on its own, comprising medical information like medication and medical history, as well as technical information, like what phone a user is using.
- [Notifications][notifications]: A service that handles push notifications.
- [Localizations][localizations]: Storage and retrieval of text snippets, translated into multiple languages.
- [Events][events]: Service that provides event (publish/subscribe) functionality for other services.

## Getting started

To get started with the ExtraHorizon SDK you'll need to install it, and then get credentials which will allow you to access the backend.

## Installation

In your project, if you are using yarn or npm you need to create a file called `.npmrc` at the root level of your project and add these lines. Replace ${AUTH_TOKEN} with your personal access token. You can get a new one at https://github.com/settings/tokens/new. Make sure you enable the `read:packages` scope.

```
@extrahorizon:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${AUTH_TOKEN}
```

Alternatively, this file can be added/edited in your home directory and it will be applied to all projects.

Explanation from GitHub on how to add your token can be found here https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry#authenticating-to-github-packages

Using npm:

```sh
npm install @extrahorizon/javascript-sdk
```

Using yarn:

```sh
yarn add @extrahorizon/javascript-sdk
```

## Quick Start

```ts
import { createOAuth2Client } from '@extrahorizon/javascript-sdk';

(async () => {
  const sdk = createOAuth2Client({
    host: '',
    clientId: '',
  });

  await sdk.auth.authenticate({
    password: '',
    username: '',
  });

  console.log('sdk.users.health()', await sdk.users.health());
  console.log('sdk.users.me()', await sdk.users.me());
})();
```

Please see [authentication examples](https://extrahorizon.github.io/javascript-sdk/#/docs/examples/authentication) for more options.

## Interceptors

The data returned from the backend is mapped using interceptors:

- Timestamps will be of type Date
- Keys in objects will be camelCased
- `records_affected` will be replaced by `affected_records`

## Developer Notes

Throughout the different services we use `this` for easy access to other functions in each service. The usage of `this` as first parameter is explained here: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/functions.html#declaring-this-in-a-function. This parameter is excluded from all exported types.

```ts
find(
  this: DataSchemasService,
  options?: { rql?: RQLString }
): Promise<PagedResult<Schema>>;
```

## 8.0.0 Upgrade Guide

### Double encoding RQL values 
From version 8.0.0 RQL values are now [double encoded](https://docs.extrahorizon.com/extrahorizon/additional-resources/resource-query-language-rql#double-encoding-of-special-characters) by default when using the rql builder, to support the use of special characters in rql operations.

In your existing application it is likely that you have encoded values provided to the rql builder using methods such as `encodeURIComponent()`. To support the automatic double encoding of special characters, where applicable, these instances of encoding should be removed.
- Before 8.0.0: `rqlBuilder().eq('diagnosis', encodeURIComponent('Hypertension - STAGE 1'))`
- After 8.0.0: `rqlBuilder().eq('diagnosis', 'Hypertension - STAGE 1')`

Any use of an rql builder that does not need to support special characters may remain as it is.

#### Reverting double encoding for a single rql builder
You may disable double encoding for an rql builder by setting the option `rqlBuilder({ doubleEncodeValues: false })`
- Before 8.0.0: `rqlBuilder().eq('diagnosis', encodeURIComponent('Hypertension - STAGE 1'))`
- After 8.0.0: `rqlBuilder({ doubleEncodeValues: false }).eq('diagnosis', encodeURIComponent('Hypertension - STAGE 1'))`

#### Reverting double encoding for all rql builders
The automatic double encoding of values can be reverted to behavior before 8.0.0 using the snippet `rqlBuilder.doubleEncodeValues = false`. This should normally exist alongside the declaration of your Extra Horizon SDK instance at the root of your application.
- You may then enable double encoding for an rql builder `rqlBuilder({ doubleEncodeValues: true }).eq('diagnosis', 'Hypertension - STAGE 1')`
- You may manually encode values for an rql builder `rqlBuilder().eq('diagnosis', encodeURIComponent('Hypertension - STAGE 1'))`

For more information regarding manual double encoding please refer to the [RQL documentation](https://docs.extrahorizon.com/extrahorizon/additional-resources/resource-query-language-rql#double-encoding-of-special-characters).
